#geoip reference
'''
USING THIS--
You may have to correct the current pygeoip library to update references to urlopen 
it is now part of urllib.request. 
Find any use of urllib.urlopen and change to urllib.request.urlopen 
Find your module by importing sys and printing sys.path
I had to do this as geoip seemed to install in more than one location and my changes were not reflected at runtime.
